  JuiceKit\231  SDK
  ----------------

Overview

  JuiceKit\231 is a Software Development Kit (SDK) for building Information Experience\231  applications. The SDK can be used by web designers and developers to build graphically rich and interactive information displays.  JuiceKit currently integrates with {{{http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/}Adobe Flex}} to create components that are easy to implement and aesthetically pleasing. Components of JuiceKit include controls, visualizations, and utility classes.

  You can get started immediately using and contributing to the project
  following {{{start.html}these quick start instructions.}}

Examples

  JuiceKit has been used to build many information visualizations and customer applications. Here are a few simple examples:

  *  {{{http://recoveryact.juiceanalytics.com/treemap/}Federal Recovery Act Treemap}} - This is an application of the JuiceKit SDK Treemap visualization to better understand the components of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

  *  {{{http://www.juicekit.org/demos/treemap4flex/}Economic Census Data Treemap}} - Every 5 years the NAICS takes an economic census. We've used this data to demonstrate using JuiceKit to implement a treemap with additional controls to change some of the display parameters.

  []
  For other examples of implementations of the JuiceKit for customers, take a look at this {{{http://www.juiceanalytics.com/writing/announcing-juicekit-sdk-open-source/}recent article}}.

  * Build the library and documentation from the {{{source-repository.html}source}} following the {{{start.html}Getting Started}} instructions.

Documentation

  Currently, only Application Programming Interface (API)
  documentation for developers is available. We plan to add best practices
  and tutorial documents soon.
